Collection of ebooks on various topics ðŸ“š 

**This is my digital library for books I have collected related to my steemit postings.**

### Book Categories:

## Physics
- [Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Physics/Facts%20and%20Mysteries%20in%20Elementary%20Particle%20Physics.pdf): *Martinus Veltman*
> This book provides a comprehensive overview of modern particle physics accessible to anyone with a true passion for wanting to know how the universe works. We are introduced to the known particles of the world we live in. An elegant explanation of quantum mechanics and relativity paves the way for an understanding of the laws that govern particle physics. These laws are put into action in the world of accelerators, colliders and detectors found at institutions such as CERN and Fermilab that are in the forefront of technical innovation. Real world and theory meet using Feynman diagrams to solve the problems of infinities and deduce the need for the Higgs boson.

## Mathematics
- [A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Mathematics/A%20Gentle%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Art%20of%20Mathematics.pdf): *Joe Fields*
> GIAM (a Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics) is a free, open-source textbook -- the current version is 3.1. GIAM covers several topics in the foundations of mathematics (logic, sets, relations, functions and cardinality) and introduces the reader to many techniques of mathematical proof (direct, indirect, contradiction, contrapositive, mathematical induction, combinatorial proofs and magic).

- [Mathematical Methods For Physicists - A Comprehensive Guide (7th Edition)]()
>  Mathematical Methods for Physicists continues to provide all the mathematical methods that aspiring scientists and engineers are likely to encounter as students and beginning researchers. This bestselling text provides mathematical relations and their proofs essential to the study of physics and related fields. While retaining the key features of the 6th edition, the new edition provides a more careful balance of explanation, theory, and examples. Taking a problem-solving-skills approach to incorporating theorems with applications, the book's improved focus will help students succeed throughout their academic careers and well into their professions. Some notable enhancements include more refined and focused content in important topics, improved organization, updated notations, extensive explanations and intuitive exercise sets, a wider range of problem solutions, improvement in the placement, and a wider range of difficulty of exercises.
