Collection of ebooks on various topics ðŸ“š 

**This is my digital library for books I have collected related to my steemit postings.**

### Book Categories:

## Physics
- [Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Physics/Facts%20and%20Mysteries%20in%20Elementary%20Particle%20Physics.pdf): *Martinus Veltman*
> This book provides a comprehensive overview of modern particle physics accessible to anyone with a true passion for wanting to know how the universe works. We are introduced to the known particles of the world we live in. An elegant explanation of quantum mechanics and relativity paves the way for an understanding of the laws that govern particle physics. These laws are put into action in the world of accelerators, colliders and detectors found at institutions such as CERN and Fermilab that are in the forefront of technical innovation. Real world and theory meet using Feynman diagrams to solve the problems of infinities and deduce the need for the Higgs boson.

## Mathematics
- [A Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Mathematics/A%20Gentle%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Art%20of%20Mathematics.pdf): *Joe Fields*
> GIAM (a Gentle Introduction to the Art of Mathematics) is a free, open-source textbook -- the current version is 3.1. GIAM covers several topics in the foundations of mathematics (logic, sets, relations, functions and cardinality) and introduces the reader to many techniques of mathematical proof (direct, indirect, contradiction, contrapositive, mathematical induction, combinatorial proofs and magic).
