- [Algorithms 1st Edition](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Mathematics/A%20Gentle%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Art%20of%20Mathematics.pdf): by *Dasgupta, Papadimitriou and Vazurani*
> This text, extensively class-tested over a decade at UC Berkeley and UC San Diego, explains the fundamentals of algorithms in a story line that makes the material enjoyable and easy to digest. Emphasis is placed on understanding the crisp mathematical idea behind each algorithm, in a manner that is intuitive and rigorous without being unduly formal.
