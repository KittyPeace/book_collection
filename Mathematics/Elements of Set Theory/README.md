- [Elements of Set Theory](https://github.com/valjen/book_collection/blob/master/Mathematics/Elements%20of%20Set%20Theory/Elements%20of%20Set%20Theory.pdf): *Herbert B. Enderton*
> This is an introductory undergraduate textbook in set theory. In mathematics these days, essentially everything is a set. Some knowledge of set theory is necessary part of the background everyone needs for further study of mathematics. It is also possible to study set theory for its own interest--it is a subject with intruiging results about simple objects. This book starts with material that nobody can do without. There is no end to what can be learned of set theory, but here is a beginning.
