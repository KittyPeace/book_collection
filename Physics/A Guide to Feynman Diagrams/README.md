> Until this book, most treatments of this topic were inaccessible to nonspecialists. A superb introduction to important areas of modern physics, it covers Feynman diagrams, quasi particles, Fermi systems at finite temperature, superconductivity, vacuum amplitude, Dyson's equation, ladder approximation, and much more. "A great delight to read." â€” Physics Today. 1974 edition.
